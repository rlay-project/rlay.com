      <p>
        As part of our private Token Sales, we are by regulation obligated to
        collect "Know-Your-Customer" data on the contributing institutions.<br />
        <br />
        In order to comply with any current and potential future regulation on
        Token Sales in the jurisdiction of Gibraltar and beyond, we conduct a
        KYC-process to be able to determine which individual or legal entity is
        contributing and where funds originate from. Thereby, Project T Ltd. is
        able to determine contributions that may be associated to criminal or
        terrorist activities as well as money laundering and can subsequently
        reject such contributions.<br />
        <br />
        It can be the case that this process requires Project T Ltd. to also
        collect personal data on individuals affiliated with the contributing
        institutions.<br />
        <br />
        Any individual's information will be held confidential and does not
        incur any further processing â€“ apart from initial review and storage -
        unless explicitly required from relevant, governmental authorities.<br />
        <br />
        Any information on the contributing entity will be held confidential and
        does not incur any further processing, unless explicitly required from
        relevant, governmental authorities.<br />
        <br />
        The collected data will be retained by Project T Ltd. for up to 5 (five)
        years as required by the "Proceeds of Crime Act" (2015).<br />
